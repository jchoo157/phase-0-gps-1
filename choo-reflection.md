*What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

	Git concepts I was struggling with prior to the GPS session was forking, fetching, and merging a repository.  After going through it more, it helped clear things up.  I still need more practice but it was very helpful.

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

How to properly fetch a repository and merge it to a local branch was clarified after we struggled through it.  I also thought forking and cloning was essentially the same thing but they serve different purposes when working on a repository.  I'll need more practice with this!

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

Sadly I don't think I asked any questions other then what we were supposed to do and what the next step was.  I'll work on this and try and find good questions to ask next time!

**What still confuses you about Git?**

I would say fetching is still a bit confusing to me but I'll be doing some more reading on it.  It was explained thorougly but I need to read up on it again to get it.  I have bad memory sadly.

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

I was pretty nervous throughout the session.  Sometimes I would forget certain terms or words and it became apparent.  Other than that, it went better than I expected.  The TA was helpful when needed and my partner was patient and understanding when I struggled.  I'll definitely be more engaging with check ins to really understand what my partner is like and how they like to work.
