* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I think I didn't really know what my weak spots were coming in, and that's something that the GPS was really good for.  If you asked me what a fetch and merge was beforehand, I would have told you, but actually having to *perform* one forced me to understand that I didn't have a full grasp on the concept.

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

I'd say I have a deeper appreciation for pushing branches and making sure to merge to master on the server side.  I was leaning towards doing all the merging locally and *then* pushing master.  Fetch was also clarified a little more for me; previously, I had been thinking about it as being more robust than it actually is.

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I needed help with the whole fetch merge thing, and my pair was the one to point me in the direction of the format of those commands.  After we were done, I asked our guide about that general fetch/merge situation to clarify what had been confusing me.

* What still confuses you about Git?

My understanding is steadily increasing the more I have to use it.  I feel like things are still a little shady for me in terms of the workflow between people in certain specific circumstances.  I get the pull requests and I get collaboration on a single repository.  But some situations have presented themselves that felt clunky to me.  Like in the first pairing session, having to work on a file within phase 0 tracks between two people with two forked repositories; I can't tell if it's just an odd situation or if there's still part of the workflow that is obtuse to me.

* How was your first experience of pairing in GPS?

Stressful!  Johnny and I were talking briefly before the start and we were both very nervous.  It was a good experience though because already for my first pair today I felt like having done the GPS really made me adjust quickly.  Not just getting stuck, but getting stuck *with* someone didn't feel great at the time, but as we worked through it, it was very obvious what a valuable experience it was.  It boosted both my confidence and my willinginess to try things and fail.
